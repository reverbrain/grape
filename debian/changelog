grape (0.6.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use queue@pop-multiple-string event to grab all queue data at once (divided by steps though to access multiple inner queues)

  * Added final() queue method, which will send data with ioremap::elliptics::exec_context::final flag set.
  *   reply() method accepts ioremap::elliptics::exec_context flags now.
